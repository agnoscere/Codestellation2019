# CultureSwap
CultureSwap is a web app that eliminates the language barrier by providing real-time translation through a chat platform. It was built with a Node.js backend, and we utilized Bootstrap and JQuery for the frontend. We let the users specify their native language, and the country they would like to be matched up with, and our app provides the automatic translation needed to have seamless text conversations.
